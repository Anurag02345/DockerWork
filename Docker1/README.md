# 🚢 DockSpace: My Containerized Creations

Welcome to **DockSpace**!  
This repository is my personal harbor of containerized projects, where I explore Docker to build scalable, efficient, and production-ready applications. 🛠️💡 Each project showcases a different aspect of containerization, from simple image creation to complex multi-container setups. 🚀

---

## 🗂️ Containerized Projects on Board:

### 🐳 [DOCKER BASICS: Hello, Container World!](https://github.com/Anurag02345/DockerWork/tree/main/Docker1/Exp-01)
- **Goal:** Kickstart my Docker journey by running the classic "Hello World" container.  
- **Key Focus:** Understanding basic Docker commands, image execution, and container runtime.

### 🖥️ [Dockerized Streamlit Development Environment](https://github.com/Anurag02345/DockerWork/tree/main/Docker1/Exp-02)
- **Goal:** Build a containerized Streamlit environment for smooth and efficient data visualization.  
- **Key Focus:** Web app deployment, interactive UI, and container efficiency.

### 🚢 [Titanic Survival Predictor: Containerized Streamlit App](https://github.com/Anurag02345/DockerWork/tree/main/Docker1/Exp-03)
- **Goal:** Deploy a Machine Learning-powered Titanic survival prediction app using Streamlit and Docker.  
- **Key Focus:** ML model serving, interactive UI, and cloud deployment.

### 🛢️ [Containerized MySQL: Agile & Efficient](https://github.com/Anurag02345/DockerWork/tree/main/Docker1/Exp-04)
- **Goal:** Deploy MySQL in a Docker container, ensuring fast, reliable, and persistent database management.  
- **Key Focus:** Data persistence, networking, and security.

### 🗄️ [Docker Volume Persistence: Bind Mounts with Linux Containers](https://github.com/Anurag02345/DockerWork/tree/main/Docker1/Exp-05)
- **Goal:** Ensure data persistence and prevent loss by using Docker volumes and bind mounts.  
- **Key Focus:** Storage management, Linux containers, and backups.

### 🌉 [Docker Bridge: Balancing Isolation & Connectivity](https://github.com/Anurag02345/DockerWork/tree/main/Docker1/Exp-06)
- **Goal:** Master Docker bridge networks to create a balance between container isolation and seamless connectivity.  
- **Key Focus:** Multi-container communication, secure networking, and efficiency.

### 🗃️ [Streamlit & PostgreSQL, Docked](https://github.com/Anurag02345/DockerWork/tree/main/Docker1/Exp-07)
- **Goal:** Connect Streamlit with PostgreSQL inside a containerized environment for real-time data interaction.  
- **Key Focus:** Full-stack integration, database handling, and scalable applications.

### 📈 [Evidently AI Sets Sail in Docker](https://github.com/Anurag02345/DockerWork/tree/main/Docker1/Exp-08)
- **Goal:** Run Evidently AI inside a Docker container to analyze ML model performance and detect data drift.  
- **Key Focus:** AI model monitoring, automation, and analytics.

### ☸️ [Minikube with Docker on Windows](https://github.com/Anurag02345/DockerWork/tree/main/Docker1/Exp-09)
- **Goal:** Set up Minikube with Docker on Windows for running Kubernetes clusters locally in a Docker container.  
- **Key Focus:** Kubernetes management, local cluster setup, and Docker integration on Windows.

### ☁️ [Deploying a Streamlit App in Docker on AWS EC2](https://github.com/Anurag02345/DockerWork/tree/main/Docker1/Exp-10)
- **Goal:** Deploy a containerized Streamlit application on an AWS EC2 instance for seamless and scalable web app hosting.  
- **Key Focus:** AWS networking, Docker containerization, cloud deployment, and security.

### ⚙️ [Microservices Orchestration with Minikube & Kubernetes](https://github.com/Anurag02345/DockerWork/tree/main/Docker1/Exp-11ML)
- **Goal:** Deploy and manage microservices efficiently using Kubernetes and Minikube.  
- **Key Focus:** Service discovery, load balancing, and containerized microservices deployment.
